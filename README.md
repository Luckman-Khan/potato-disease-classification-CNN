This project explores image classification of potato leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The goal is to detect whether a potato plant is healthy or affected by early blight or late blight, based on the PlantVillage dataset.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Source: PlantVillage Dataset (Kaggle)

Classes:

Early Blight

Late Blight
